This application is a mobile app for the android platform.  It takes the call and sms log and complies a few stats.
This has been my first attempt at a mobile app so I have been learning along with coding.

I was told by Jim M. during the party monday that I have been selected but since I was missing a real world app in 
a modern language I had not yet been placed.  This is the app I had worked on this week.  He had told me to get it
in as soon as I could so I could be placed.

Thanks
